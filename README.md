**Neural Turing Machine for modelling attention.**\
The implementation is based on https://github.com/MarkPKCollier/NeuralTuringMachine.

1. setup_dataset.py - passing images through CNN and saving them locally to speed up the training process
2. run_tasks.py - parameter initialization and training
